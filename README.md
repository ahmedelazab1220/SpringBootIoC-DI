# IoC & Dependency Injection in Spring Boot

Before we dive into IOC & DI, let's take a moment to have a clear understanding of what is SPRING ðŸ‘‡:

- Spring is a popular open-source framework for building enterprise applications in Java. Developed by Pivotal Software (a division of VMware).
- the Spring Framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to develop robust and maintainable Java applications.
- It provide many Key features and components such as : Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Data Access, Transaction Management, Data Access, Model-View-Controller (MVC), Security, Spring         Boot ... .

Dependency Injection is a design pattern (way) of passing the dependencies of an object to that object, rather than having the object create its own dependencies.

let's have a general overall view of What is Dependecy Injection in a simple and general terms :

First of all DI is a design pattern and a fundamental concept in software development, particularly in object-oriented programming.

- It's a technique that promotes loose coupling between different components or classes in a software system, making the code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.

- dependency injection refers to the process of providing the required dependencies (objects or services) that a class or component needs to function correctly, rather than letting the class create those dependencies itself.

- These dependencies are typically passed to the class from an external source, such as a configuration file, a framework, or another class responsible for managing the dependencies

Tight Coupling:

- Definition: Tight coupling refers to a situation where classes or components are highly dependent on each other's concrete implementations. Example: Directly instantiating objects or referencing concrete classes within another class.

Loose Coupling:
- Definition: Loose coupling refers to reducing dependencies between components by relying on abstractions, interfaces, or dependency injection. Example: Using interfaces, abstractions, or DI containers to decouple components.

![Loose Coupling](https://github.com/ahmedelazab1220/SpringBootIoC-DI/assets/105994948/43aa0bfd-2be6-43b0-84f3-d37d2c511287)


There are three main types of dependency injection:

- Constructor injection: This is the most common type of dependency injection. In constructor injection, the dependencies of an object are passed to its constructor.

- Setter injection: In setter injection, the dependencies of an object are passed to its setters.

- Field injection: In Field injection, the dependencies of an object are passed to it through an Field.

Dependency injection can be used to achieve a number of benefits, including:

- Loose coupling : Dependency injection makes the code more loosely coupled, which means that the code is less dependent on other parts of the code. This makes the code more flexible and easier to test.

- Testability : Dependency injection makes the code more testable, because the dependencies of an object can be mocked or stubbed out in unit tests.

- Reusability : Dependency injection makes the code more reusable, because the dependencies of an object can be injected at runtime. This means that the same object can be used in different contexts, without having to modify the code of the object.


## Without Dependency Injection : 

``` 
   public class TennisCoach {
      private FortuneService fortuneService;

      public TennisCoach() {
         this.fortuneService = new FortuneService(); // Direct instantiation
      }

      public FortuneService getFortuneService(){
        //
           ........
           //
        return fortuneService;
      }
   }

```

``` 
   public class FortuneService {

      public FortuneService() {

      }

      public String getFortuneService(){
        //
           ........
        //
      }
   }
   
```

## With Dependency Injection :

``` 
   public class TennisCoach {
      private FortuneService fortuneService;

      public TennisCoach(FortuneService fortuneService) {
         this.fortuneService = fortuneService(); // Dependency injection through constructor
      }

      public FortuneService getFortuneService(){
        //
           ........
           //
        return fortuneService;
      }
   }

```
